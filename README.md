### Data Maps

| Map | Purpose | Key Structure |
|-----|---------|---------------|
| `photographer-profiles` | User profiles and stats | `principal` |
| `photo-walks` | Walk event details | `uint` (walk-id) |
| `shoot-logs` | Photography session records | `uint` (shoot-id) |
| `walk-reviews` | Event reviews and ratings | `{walk-id, reviewer}` |
| `photographer-milestones` | Achievement tracking | `{photographer, milestone}` |
| `token-balances` | PLT holdings | `principal` |

### Innovative Features

#### 1. Dynamic Skill Rating
Skill rating increases based on composition scores:
```clarity
skill-rating: (+ (get skill-rating profile) (/ composition u12))
```
Progressive improvement tracking rewards consistent quality.

#### 2. Quality Score Averaging
Photo walks maintain rolling average quality:
```clarity
new-quality-score: (/ (+ current-quality composition) new-shoot-count)
```
Helps photographers find high-quality events.

#### 3. Satisfaction-Based Rewards
- Satisfied shoots: Full 2.8 PLT reward
- Unsatisfied shoots: Reduced 0.93 PLT reward
- Encourages honest self-assessment without penalizing experimentation
